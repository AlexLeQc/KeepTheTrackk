Testing Firebase integration.

## Deployment

To deploy changes:

1.  **Build the project**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Vite creates a clean production build in the `/dist` directory.

2.  **Deploy to Firebase**
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```
    Firebase uploads the `/dist` directory and updates the live site.
